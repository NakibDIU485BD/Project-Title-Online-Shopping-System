This project is a console-based Online Shopping System developed in Java, where users can register, log in, browse products, add items to a shopping cart, and complete orders through checkout.
It includes features like product stock management, user authentication, and order history tracking.
Admins can log in separately to view all customer orders.
The system ensures a smooth shopping flow with a simple menu-driven interface.
